## Overview

This AI agent automates Reddit marketing for lead generation by tracking industries, keywords, brands, and competitors on Reddit, then automatically engaging with Redditors to promote your brand authentically and on autopilot.

Built on [TaskAGI.net](https://taskagi.net), this workflow combines RSS monitoring, AI-powered content generation, and intelligent filtering to create authentic Reddit engagement at scale.

## Key Features

- **Automated Keyword Monitoring** - Tracks Reddit mentions via RSS feeds (F5Bot integration)
- **AI-Generated Authentic Comments** - Uses Claude Sonnet 4 to write natural, conversational Reddit comments
- **Smart Filtering** - Only engages on relevant posts matching your target keywords
- **Duplicate Prevention** - Google Sheets integration prevents posting multiple times on the same thread
- **Customizable Prompts** - Tailor the AI's tone and messaging to your brand
- **Autopilot Operation** - Runs continuously with scheduled triggers
- **Content Relevance Checking** - Skips posts that aren't genuinely relevant to avoid spam

## How It Works

This agent follows a 5-step intelligent workflow:

1. **Monitor RSS Feed** - F5Bot RSS feed continuously monitors Reddit for target keywords (app marketing, b2b marketing, saas marketing, reddit marketing, software marketing, ai agent)

2. **Filter Keywords** - Checks if the post matches your target keywords before proceeding

3. **Read Post Context** - Fetches the full Reddit post with up to 50 comments to understand the conversation

4. **Check Duplicate History** - Searches Google Sheet to verify you haven't already commented on this thread

5. **Generate & Post Comment** - If new and relevant:
   - Claude AI generates an authentic, helpful Reddit comment
   - Checks if content is genuinely relevant (returns "skip" if not)
   - Posts comment via Reddit API
   - Logs the post permalink to prevent future duplicates

- Low activity: 1-4 hours

### Multi-Product Support
Duplicate the workflow and customize prompts for different products or brands you're promoting.

### Comment Review Queue
Add a notification node (email/Slack) before posting to manually review AI-generated comments before they go live.

### Sentiment Analysis
Add a sentiment analysis node to only engage on positive or neutral discussions, avoiding negative threads.

### Upvote Tracking
Extend the Google Sheet to track comment performance (upvotes, replies) by periodically checking comment status.

## Best Practices

### Reddit Marketing Compliance

1. **Be Authentic** - The AI is trained to write like a real Reddit user, not a marketer
2. **Provide Value First** - Always answer questions or contribute helpfully before mentioning your product
3. **Disclose Association** - The default prompt includes disclosure that you work on the product
4. **Respect Subreddit Rules** - Check each subreddit's self-promotion policies
5. **Don't Spam** - The duplicate prevention system helps, but monitor your activity
6. **Engage Naturally** - Don't only post promotional comments; participate genuinely

### Optimizing AI Comments

1. **Test Different Prompts** - Experiment with tone, length, and style in the Claude prompt
2. **Review First Week** - Check generated comments daily initially to ensure quality
3. **Adjust Temperature** - Lower temperature (0.5-0.7) for more consistent, conservative responses
4. **Add Context** - Include more details about your product's unique value in the prompt
5. **Monitor Feedback** - Track upvotes/downvotes and adjust approach based on reception

### Keywords Strategy

1. **Start Broad** - Include general industry terms to find more opportunities
2. **Refine Over Time** - Remove keywords that generate too many irrelevant matches
3. **Use F5Bot Features** - Set up multiple alerts with different keyword combinations
4. **Track Competitors** - Monitor competitor brand names to engage in comparison discussions
5. **Industry Trends** - Add trending industry terms as they emerge

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Finding Posts
- Verify F5Bot RSS feed URL is correct and accessible
- Check if F5Bot alerts are active and generating new items
- Confirm RSS node polling interval is set correctly

### Comments Not Posting
- Verify Reddit OAuth credentials are valid and not expired
- Check Reddit API rate limits (you may need to slow down execution)
- Ensure Reddit account has enough karma and isn't shadowbanned
- Review Reddit node configuration for correct parent_id reference

### Duplicate Comments Still Happening
- Confirm Google Sheet URL is correct in both Search and Append nodes
- Verify sheet permissions allow TaskAGI to read and write
- Check that the search_value field matches the append field exactly
- Ensure sheet has header row and data starts in correct location

### AI Comments Are Too Promotional
- Increase emphasis on "provide value first" in the prompt
- Add more examples of natural Reddit conversation style
- Lower the Claude temperature parameter for more conservative responses
- Add stricter rules about when to mention your product

### High AI Costs
- Reduce schedule trigger frequency (e.g., from 1 minute to 5 minutes)
- Tighten keyword filters to reduce false positives
- Limit comment_limit in Reddit read node to reduce token usage
- Consider using Claude Haiku instead of Sonnet for lower cost

## FAQ

### Is this against Reddit's Terms of Service?

- Generate authentic, helpful comments (not spam)
- Include disclosure of association with the product

Yes! Duplicate the workflow and customize the prompts and keywords for each product. You can run multiple agents simultaneously on TaskAGI.

The agent includes a relevance check where Claude returns "skip" if it determines content is irrelevant. You can also add a manual review step by inserting a notification node before the Create Comment node.

### How do I track ROI?

Extend the Google Sheet to include:
- Timestamp of each comment
- Post URL and title
- Upvotes/replies (check periodically)
- Traffic driven (use UTM parameters if allowed)
